# Webpage Slideshow Display

A lightweight HTML/JavaScript project that automatically cycles through webpages in fullscreen mode.
This project is designed for advertising and awareness, making it easy to showcase a website on screens during events, offices, or public spaces.

## ✨ Features

- Optional auto-scroll for long pages

- Zero setup — just open in a browser

A general-purpose GUI version will be released soon, so everyone can easily customize their own slideshow.

This project can be used on:

- Office screens

- Event displays

- Waiting rooms

- Public monitors

## 🚀 How to Use

- Download or clone the project.

- Open slideshow.html in Google Chrome (press F11 for fullscreen).
